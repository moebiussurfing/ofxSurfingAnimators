# ofxOneEuroFilter

“The 1€ ﬁlter (“one Euro ﬁlter”) is a simple algorithm to ﬁlter noisy signals for high precision and responsiveness. It uses a ﬁrst order low-pass ﬁlter with an adaptive cutoff frequency: at low speeds, a low cutoff stabilizes the signal by reducing jitter, but as speed increases, the cutoff is increased to reduce lag.” [Casiez 2012]
